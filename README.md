Pi estimations 
========================

This small Javascript application illustrates the concept of Monte Carlo method used to calculate the value of Pi.

It works with HTML5 canvas so make sure you don't use a retarded browser.
To run it, simply extract it locally and open monte-carlo.html in your browser.

Monte Carlo method
------------------------

Consider a square with side equals one. Now consider a circle within the square. 
* Square area is 1*1 = 1
* Circle radius is 0.5 so the area is Pi x Radius x Radius = Pi/4

By randomly drawing points on the board (think of throwing darts on a dartboard) we know that the ratio of points in the circle compared to the number of total points is Pi/4.
Multiply the ratio by 4 to get an approximation of Pi value.

Javascript application
------------------------

The application is a Single Page Applications (SPA) and makes use of AngularJS library and Twitter Bootstrap.
I recommend watching this great video for a quick overview of AngularJS:
